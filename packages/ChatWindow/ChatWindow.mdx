# ChatWindow

The `ChatWindow` component represents a draggable and resizable chat window interface powered by the OpenAI chatbot, NucBot. The component includes a chat header, content area for displaying chat history, a text field for new user messages, and a button for submitting new messages.

## Usage

To make use of the `ChatWindow` component, you will need to pass certain props to it. Here's an explanation of each prop:

- `open`: A boolean value indicating whether the chat window is open or closed.
- `handleClose`: A function to handle the closing of the chat window.
- `handleNewUserMessage`: A function to handle new user messages. This function receives the message as its argument.
- `history`: An optional array of message objects to populate the chat window with existing messages. Each object should have a `message` property for the message text, and a `user` property which is true for user messages and false for bot messages.
