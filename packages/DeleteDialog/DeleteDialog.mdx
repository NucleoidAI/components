This component shows a dialog for confirming a delete operation. It can handle two types of deletions: resources and methods.

The type of deletion is determined by the `type` prop, which can either be "resource" or "method".

The component has two main functions:

- `setOpen`: A function for controlling the dialog visibility.
- `deleteFunction`: A function for executing the delete operati
